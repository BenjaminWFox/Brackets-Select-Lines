Brackets Select Line extension
===
Simple extension to allow selecting lines by clicking and dragging along the editor gutter.

To install this extension:
In Brackets, under "Help" select "Show Extensions Folder". Place extension folder with files inside the "user" folder.
Older versions of Brackets this choice might be under "Debug" or might not exist at all.


Usage
=====
If installed it is always active.
Click and drag on the numbers within the gutter. Where you start and stop does not matter. It selects whichever line numbers you hover over while the mouse button is down.


Known issues
=====
Selecting one line can be bothersome.
If line extends beyond right edge of editor window the scrollbar will jump to the right.
Kind of flaky, sometimes it just stops working. Doesn't seem to like editor focus changing.

Research ways to prevent scrollbar jumping.
